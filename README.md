disquiet0138
============

This is code made in collarberation with cmol to create sound for the 138th Disquiet Junto.

Final result can (soon) be heard on soundcloud.

The video file gets analyzed in Processing and data sent with OSC to SuperCollider.
SuperCollider takes incoming data, dynamically creates synths and plays back sound. All in realtime!

Requieres video file to recreate.
